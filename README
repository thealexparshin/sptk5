---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to SPTK version 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the root directory of SPTK. It contains CMake project 
files that allow building for several systems, supported by CMake.

The example applications are in ./examples. They are built only if
examples flag is requested during CMake project configuration.

If you experience any problem building or using SPTK, please 
let me know at alexeyp@gmail.com.

The new and old versions of SPTK can be downloaded from http://www.sptk.net.

How to build SPTK
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTENTION: Sqlite version 3.3.8 doesn't work properly with SPTK.
           You need version 3.3.7 or before.

1. Windows and Cygwin.

a) Install Gygwin. Make sure that gcc, autotools (automake and autoconf),
   binutils, cvs, doxygen, libtool, make are installed.
   Do not install FLTK. Cygwin includes FLTK 1.1.4 that is way too old.

b) Install FLTK version 1.1.6 or higher (but not 2.x!).
   You can get it from http://www.fltk.org.

c) Install sqlite3 runtime. You can get it from http://www.sqlite.org.
   The sqlite3.dll should be placed into the library search path, and 
   sqlite.h should be in include search path.
   Do not install the sqlite3 version 3.3.8 available on the website.
   We have discovered - it has a bug that doesn't allow it to work with SPTK.

d) Install CMake version 2.6 or higher.

e) Install latest SPTK from this web site, and unpack it to local directory.
   Then build it (by default, the libraries and includes are installed under 
   /usr/local/):

   cd sptk5
   cmake .
   make
   make install

2. Windows and VC++ 7/8.

a) Verify that ODBC support is installed.

b) In the directory of your choice, create the following structure:
  BuildDirectory
    +---fltk
    +---sqlite
    L---sptk3
   The libraries you will be installing should be placed in that structure,
   otherwise you have to update the project files

c) Install FLTK version 1.1.6 or higher (but not 2.x!).
   You can get it from http://www.fltk.org.
   Move/rename the FLTK directory into your BuildDirectory.
   Open the VC workspace and build the solution.
   Verify that test programs (in fltk/test/) run.

d) Copy sqlite3 runtime into your BuildDirectory. 
   You can get it from http://www.sqlite.org.
   The sqlite3.dll should be placed into the search path.
   Do not install the sqlite3 version 3.3.8 available on the website.
   We have discovered - it has a bug that doesn't allow it to work with SPTK.

d) Install CMake version 2.6 or higher.

e) Install latest SPTK from this web site. Unpack it to local directory.
   Run CMake GUI from Windows menu, and configure the local sptk directory.

   Open the VC workspace and build the solution.
   Verify that test programs (in sptk5/bin/) run properly.

f) Install OpenSSL from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.

g) Install PCRE from http://www.airesoft.co.uk/pcre, into C:\Windows\Program Files (x86)\PCRE

3. Linux

   Install the following packages:

a) optionally: ODBC support (like unixODBC)

b) optionally: Sqlite3 version 3.3 to 3.3.7 (not 3.3.8!)

c) optionally: Libpq version 4.x or higher (PostgreSQL C-interface)

d) FLTK version 1.1.5 to 1.1.7 (not 2.x!) 

e) optionally: Aspell

f) CMake version 2.6 or higher.

g) Install latest SPTK from this site, and unpack it to local directory.
   Then build it (by default, the libraries and includes are installed under /usr/local/):

   cd sptk5
   cmake .
   make
   make install
