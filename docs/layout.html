Introduction</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">I'm developing FLTK applications
for about a year for now, and have ported some of my Windows projects
from Borland C++ Builder to FLTK. The process went more or less
painful, and now I have several projects working. During the porting
I've noticed that some part of coding took most of my time. I also
noticed that I didn't like this exact part of coding :) I'm talking
about placing the widgets on the form or window. FLTK allows you to
place the widgets just nicely, it also allows to define how widgets
should be resized if the form or window is resized. Unfortunately,
the traditional FLTK way resizes widgets in both directions &ndash;
height and width. It's not exactly what user of the application
expects from it, especially when the application has widgets like
combo box or numeric input. These widgets should be resized the very
certain way, keeping the vertical size in certain limits specific to
widget. Trying to meet such size requirements, I had to implement a
virtual resize() method in every window or form of my programs. I
didn't like it. It takes too much work and too much time. Also, the
constructor of every window contained widgets with sizes defined.
Unfortunately, resize function doesn't really need these sizes, or
even ignores them completely. I didn't like it ether. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
Idea</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">After some experiments, I've
decided to implement the automatic layout manager. The main goal was
to provide minimum work required from the programmer to use it, and
to make program shorter. It should also better use the constructor
information, and shouldn't require to define virtual resize() method.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">First, the idea was to define a
widget alignment as one of: right, left, top, bottom and client. The
widget alignment supposed to tell the application how the widget
should be located.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Second, every widget has different
size limitations or preferences. To solve this problem, someone in
FLTK Usenet group proposed to define a preferred size method. That
method would tell the system how the widget wants to be resized. I'd
be glad to mention the author of this nice idea as soon as I have his
name.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Third, to handle the extra widget
information it takes to use a special group. That group should be
smart enough to ask the widgets about their preferred sizes, and
locate them accordingly to the available space. Also, the group often
enough may need the extra space and should be able to grow, so all
the widgets inside would fit.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The
implementation</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>From the idea' description I've pictured two basic classes:
CLayoutClient and CLayoutManager. The CLayoutClient is used as one of
the basic classes for the widget in order to let the layout manager
know &ndash; it's our guy and we have to locate him properly.
CLayoutManager class is managing the client widgets that is derived
from CLayoutClient. It doesn't mean the widgets should be derived
from <I><B>only</B> </I>CLayoutClient. The widgets should be derived
from the original widget, say, Fl_Input, <B><I>and</I></B>
CLayoutClient. Here is the example (not a real class):</P>
<P>class CMyInput : public Fl_Input, public CLayoutClient {</P>
<P>public:</P>
<P>CMyInput(int x, int y, int w, int h, const char *label=0L) :
Fl_Input(x,y,w,h,label), CLayoutClient(SP_ALIGN_TOP) {}</P>
<P>virtual void preferredSize(int&amp; width, int&amp; height) const;</P>
<P>};</P>
<P>As soon as we have such class definition, we can use that class
with CLayoutManager. The only problem is &ndash; the layout manager
doesn't need the location and size of the widget defined in
constructor. What it needs, however, is the optional size of the
widget (depending on the alignment, it's height or width) and the
widget alignment in layout. So, the optimal constructor should look
like this:</P>
<P>CMyInput(const char *label=0L, int layoutSize=10, CLayoutAlign
alignment=SP_ALIGN_TOP);</P>
<P>The default values are chosen based on the most popular values: A
lot of the forms are placing the widgets from top to bottom, that
gives us the alignment=SP_ALIGN_TOP. And, in many cases, the widgets
have the preferredSize() method defining the exact size of the
widget, or at least &ndash; the exact height of it. Want to see the
example? The Fl_Input widget, for instance, if it's not in multi-line
mode, should always have the certain height, based on the widget
font. The CDateTimeInput widget is even more strict, requiring both
height and width defined based on the widget font. But, the widgets
like Fl_Browser may have the height and width only limited by the
minimal value (something like double font size), and we have to
provide some information about the desirable widget size. What should
be inside the preferredSize() method? It is very simple. If the
widget wants to take any size it's asked &ndash; the body of that
method should be empty. Otherwise, the widget simply checks the
values of arguments width and height and changes them if necessary.
For instance, if the widget may have any width bigger than 20, and
the height always 20, the method should look like:</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">void CMyInput::preferredSize(int&amp; width,
int&amp; height) const {</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">if (width &lt;
20) width = 20;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">height = 20;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#800000">}</FONT></P>
<P>In SPTK, the kind of the constructor I've just described, is
widely used. In fact, to use the regular FLTK constructors for SPTK
widgets, you have to define __COMPATIBILITY_MODE__ constant during
the SPTK compilation. Otherwise, the old style constructors are
simply not included. So the code creating several of widgets looks
like:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CInput(&ldquo;first name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new CInput(&ldquo;last
name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CDateInput(&ldquo;birth date&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P>Looks pretty strange for FLTK, isn't it? Yet, it works. Of course,
it doesn't work as it should if used with the regular Fl_Group. In
order for layout to work properly, the widgets with layout support
should be placed in ClayoutManager-based class. SPTK provides two of
such classes: CGroup and CWindow. So, the complete window code looks
like:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">CWindow
*w = new CWindow(300,300,&rdquo;My window&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CInput(&ldquo;first name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CInput(&ldquo;last name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CDateInput(&ldquo;birth date&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">w-&gt;end();</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">w-&gt;resizable(w);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">That's all! CWindow </FONT>will place the
widgets one by one from the top to the bottom, resize them correctly
even if the window size is changed. 
</P>
<P>If you need to use the widget with less strictly defined
preferredSize(), the code should include an extra size value, like:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">CWindow
*w = new CWindow(300,300,&rdquo;My window&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CInput(&ldquo;first name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CInput(&ldquo;last name&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CDateInput(&ldquo;birth date&rdquo;);</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CListView(&ldquo;Work history&rdquo;,150);</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">w-&gt;end();</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">w-&gt;resizable(w);</FONT></P>
<P>In that example, ListView will have the height of 150 pixels, and
will keep this height even if the window is resized. If you want the
widget to occupy all the space not taken by other widgets, the widget
is created with the client-alignment. The size value is simply
ignored.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><FONT COLOR="#800000">new
CListView(&ldquo;Work history&rdquo;, 10, SP_ALIGN_CLIENT);</FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>How
Does it work?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Let's say we start from the empty CWindow object, and add several
widgets. The following code is a simplified version from the
examples/cgroup_test.cpp (see SPTK distribution):</P>
<PRE>int main() {
    CWindow w(500,400,&quot;CGroup test&quot;);
    w.resizable(w);
    w.color(0xC0C8FF00);

    // CCheckButtons figures out the size from the list
    // of choices. The default alignment is SP_ALIGN_TOP,
    // and you can change it in ctor
    CCheckButtons cbl(&quot;Check Buttons: &quot;);
    cbl.buttons(CStringList(&quot;first,second,third,*&quot;,&quot;,&quot;));

    CRadioButtons rbl(&quot;Radio Buttons: &quot;);
    rbl.buttons(CStringList(&quot;first,second,third,*&quot;,&quot;,&quot;));

    // CListView is more flexible, than CCheckButtons or
    // CRadioButtons, it's vertical size is defined with
    // the layoutSize parameter in ctor as 150.
    // SP_ALIGN_CLIENT allows that widget to occupy all
    // the space left after all the other widgets are 
    // put in place
    CListView listView(&quot;List View:&quot;,10,SP_ALIGN_CLIENT);
    listView.columns().add(CColumn(&quot;column 1&quot;,VAR_INT,70));
    listView.columns().add(CColumn(&quot;column 2&quot;,VAR_INT,70));
    listView.columns().add(CColumn(&quot;column 3&quot;,VAR_STRING,200));
    listView.columns().add(CColumn(&quot;column 4&quot;,VAR_STRING));

    // That group keeps togeteher the buttons. These
    // buttons use the default alignment for buttons - 
    // SP_ALIGN_RIGHT, and the text/icon defined by the 
    // button kind.
    CGroup buttonGroup(&quot;&quot;,10,SP_ALIGN_BOTTOM);
    buttonGroup.color(0xA0A0E000);
    CButton okButton(SP_OK_BUTTON);
    okButton.defaultButton(true);
    CButton addButton(SP_ADD_BUTTON);
    CButton nextButton(SP_NEXT_BUTTON);
    buttonGroup.end();

    w.end();
    w.show();

    Fl::run();

    return 0;

<P>At the moment we create the window and fill it with the widgets &ndash;
none of the widgets has the correct size. When the window is shown,
at some moment FLTK calls that window resize() method, and layout
manager comes forward. The layout manager processes the widgets in
the order they were created. So, let's try to watch how it's done. 
</P>
<TABLE WIDTH=802 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>

		<TD WIDTH=447>
			<P>The very beginning. When the layout manager starts to work,
			none of the components is located and sized correctly. The is
			considered as an empty area, with the size (ww, hh) pixels. This
			area is slightly smaller than the available window area if the
			layoutSpacing() is not 0. layoutSpacing() defines the extra space
			between the widgets</P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=355>
			<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/layout_step2.png" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=395 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
			</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=447>
			<P>The first widget to place is CCheckButtons cbl. Layout manager
			calls the preferredSize() method for that widget and finds out
			what is the optimal widht and height of the widget. For the check
			buttons the height is determined based on the actual number of
			check buttons inside. The width of the widget isn't limited, so it
			takes all the available width of the area. 
			</P>
			<P>The default layout alignment is SP_ALIGN_TOP, so the widget is
			aligned to the top of available area.</P>
			<P>After placing the widget, layout manager decreases the size of
			the available by the size taken by the widget.</P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=355>
			<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/layout_step3.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=346 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
			</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=447>
			<P>After placing the first widget, the layout manager switches to
			the second one (in the order the widgets were created). Once
			again, the widget is asked through the preferredSize() method how
			it wants to be resized. The layout manager resizes the widget with
			the default layout align to the top of the available area and once
			again decreases the area size.</P>
			<P>Next widget to process is CListView with the layout alignment
			as SP_ALIGN_CLIENT. This is a special alignment &ndash; only one
			widget inside the group may have it. Layout manager takes a note
			about this widget but doesn't resize it before all the other
			widgets in the group are resized. 
			</P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=355>
			<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/layout_step4.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=395 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
			</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=447>
			<P>Next, the CGroup buttonGroup is asked for the preferredSize().
			This is little bit more complicated than before, but not for you &ndash;
			for layout manager. Layout manager first computes the
			preferredSize() for every widget inside the group, and then
			computes the preferredSize() for itself. After it's done, the
			parent group (the window) resizes the buttonGroup and puts it to
			the buttom of the available area as defined by the constructor:</P>
			<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">CGroup buttonGroup(&quot;&quot;,10,SP_ALIGN_BOTTOM);</PRE><P>
			The group that was originally created with the height 10 grows to
			fit all the buttons inside.</P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR VALIGN=TOP>
		<TD WIDTH=355>
			<P><IMG SRC="../pictures/layout_step5.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=444 HEIGHT=383 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
			</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=447>
			<P>And, finaly, the moment of truth - the very last step. After
			all the other widgets are placed, layout manager places the widget
			with the layout align SP_ALIGN_CLIENT (if you had one, of course).
			It tries to take all the remaining space, if the preferredSize()
			allows to do so.</P>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>The whole set of operations is repeated when you resize the
window. Of course, nothing is perfect. The layout manager ignores the
regular widgets, not based on CLayoutClient, completely. But, if you
want to use some favorite widget of yours with the layout manager,
simply subclass it from your original widget and CLayoutClient.</P>
